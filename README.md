ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Matthew Kolakowski
About Me- 
As a Senior Quantitative Analytics Specialist at Wells Fargo, I leverage my 15+ years of experience in analytics, technical project management, and business process improvement to support deposit and trading balance forecasting models for regulatory compliance and strategic decision-making. I have a Master of Science in Health Analytics from Duke University, a Ph.D. in Business Administration and Management from Oklahoma State University, and a Project Management Professional (PMP) certification from the Project Management Institute.

I employ advanced machine learning techniques to evaluate the deposit and trading balance risk models and provide valuable insights to stakeholders. I also teach graduate-level analytics tools and programming courses at Trine University and Clemson University, where I share my passion and expertise in analytics. Additionally, I have authored multiple publications in peer-reviewed journals on topics such as employee well-being, e-learning, and leadership in healthcare. I am motivated by the opportunity to apply my analytical and technical skills to solve complex problems and create a positive impact.
